Reffer to the [python notebook](https://github.com/abhi094/Kaggle-Competitions/blob/master/Digit%20Recognizer/MNIST_PCA_KNN_RF.ipynb) for code details

#### Summary
- Explored the effect of changing the number of components of PCA on accuracy of prediction when using KNN
- Analyzed the effect of changing estimators of Random Forests on accuracy of predcition 
- Compared Random Forests prediction with the earlier results from KNN with PCA
